# [Designing, Running, and Analyzing Experiments](https://www.coursera.org/learn/designexperiments)


The course covers designing user-centered experiments, running and analyzing data from these experiments, and evaluating and validating user experiences. Real-world examples from the fields of UX, IxD, and HCI are used to understand issues in experiment design and analysis. Participants will analyze multiple data sets using R statistical programming language, with no prior programming experience assumed or required. By the end of the course, participants will be able to design, run, and analyze their own experiments that give statistical weight to their designs.


## Syllabus

### Week 1: Introduction to Experimentation
- Basic concepts relevant to the design and analysis of experiments
- Mean comparisons, variance, statistical significance, practical significance, sampling, inclusion, and exclusion criteria, and informed consent
- Thinking of an experiment in terms of usability, its participants, apparatus, procedure, and design & analysis.

### Week 2: Tests of Proportions
- Analyzing user preferences (or other tallies) using tests of proportions
- Independent and dependent variables, variable types, exploratory data analysis, p-values, asymptotic tests, exact tests, one-sample tests, two-sample tests, - Chi-Square test, G-test, Fisher’s exact test, binomial test, multinomial test, post hoc tests, and pairwise comparisons
- Introduction to R and RStudio.

### Week 3: The T-Test
- Design and analysis of a simple website A/B test
- Measurement error, independent variables as factors, factor levels, between-subjects factors, within-subjects factors, dependent variables as responses, response types, balanced designs, and how to report a t-test
- Independent-samples t-test, analysis of variance.

### Week 4: Validity in Design and Analysis
- Ensuring that data is valid through the design of experiments
- Testing for certain assumptions to ensure the validity of analyses
- Experimental control, confounds, ecological validity, the three assumptions of ANOVA, data distributions, residuals, normality, homoscedasticity, parametric versus nonparametric tests, the Shapiro-Wilk test, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Levene’s test, the Brown-Forsythe test, and the Mann-Whitney U test.

### Week 5: One-Factor Between-Subjects Experiments
- One-factor between-subjects experiments
- Independent-samples t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, one-way ANOVA, and Kruskal-Wallis test
- Analysis of data from two-level factors and three-level factors, omnibus tests, and post hoc pairwise comparisons with adjustments for multiple comparisons.

### Week 6: One-Factor Within-Subjects Experiments
- One-factor within-subjects experiments
- Within-subjects study of subjects searching for contacts in a smartphone contacts manager
- Analysis of times, errors, and effort Likert-type scale ratings
- Counterbalancing strategies to avoid carryover effects, including full counterbalancing, Latin - Squares, and balanced Latin Squares
Paired-samples t-test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, one-way repeated measures ANOVA, and Friedman test.


### Week 7: Factorial Experiment Designs
- Experiments with multiple factors and factorial ANOVAs
- Text entry performance on different smartphone keyboards while sitting, standing, and walking
- Mixed factorial designs, interaction effects, factorial ANOVAs, and the Aligned Rank Transform as a nonparametric factorial ANOVA.


### Week 8: Generalizing the Response
- Analyses for non-normal or non-numeric responses for between-subjects experiments using Generalized Linear Models (GLM)
- Response distributions, nominal logistic regression, ordinal logistic regression, and Poisson regression.


### Week 9: The Power of Mixed Effects Models
- Mixed effects models, specifically Linear Mixed Models (LMM) and Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM)
- Revisiting the prior experiment on text entry performance on smartphones, keeping every single measurement trial as part of the analysis
- Review of the full set of analyses covered in this course.
